# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Agent League expands TradeWizard's Market Intelligence Engine with specialized AI agents that analyze prediction markets from diverse perspectives. While the foundational engine provides core market analysis through three MVP agents (Market Microstructure, Probability Baseline, Risk Assessment), the Advanced Agent League adds event intelligence, sentiment analysis, polling data, price action timing, and risk philosophy agents. This creates a comprehensive "digital trading firm" that mirrors how professional forecasting organizations make decisions—with analysts, strategists, and risk managers all contributing unique perspectives before reaching consensus.

## Glossary

- **Advanced Agent League**: The expanded set of specialized AI agents that provide comprehensive market analysis beyond the MVP agent set
- **Event Intelligence Agent**: An agent that monitors and interprets real-world events (news, policy, court rulings) that impact market outcomes
- **Sentiment Agent**: An agent that analyzes public sentiment from media coverage and social discourse
- **Polling Agent**: An agent that aggregates and analyzes polling data, adjusting for bias and detecting momentum shifts
- **Price Action Agent**: An agent that analyzes market price movements, momentum, and mean reversion patterns
- **Risk Philosophy Agent**: An agent that advocates for a specific risk approach (aggressive, conservative, or neutral)
- **Agent Signal Fusion**: The process of combining signals from multiple specialized agents into a unified market view
- **Signal Weight**: The relative importance assigned to each agent's signal based on agent type and market context
- **Agent Specialization**: The principle that each agent focuses on a specific analytical domain to avoid redundancy
- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: The capability to ingest data from external sources (news APIs, polling aggregators, social media)
- **Dynamic Agent Selection**: The ability to activate different agent combinations based on market type and available data
